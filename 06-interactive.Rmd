## Description

This interactive part contains two plots. One is a timeline showing the trend of CO2 concentration from 2019 to 2020. Another is a mutli-timeline showing the changing trend of different months in each year. We can compare any subsets of them. In our graph, we only take 4 years as example for clarity. Actually, we can use as many years as possible, and this interactive graph will be extreme useful to compare the trends of specific years.
