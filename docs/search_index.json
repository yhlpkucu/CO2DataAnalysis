This file contains monthly co2 data collected from several different inspection stations, whose locations are shown in the figure below. Inspection stations Read data from “monthly_flask_co2”. Variable description: Yr: year Mn: month alt: Alert Station mlo: Mauna Loa Observatory kum: Cape Kumukahi Station chr: Christmas Island Station sam: American Samoa Station ker: Kermadec Island Station nzd: New Zealand Station Firstly, we analysis its missing patterns. As shown in the graph above, each inspection station has NA values in its column, while year and month columns don&#39;t have missing data. The Alert station has the highest missing percentage and missing count while the Mauna Loa Observatory has the lowest missing percentage and missing count. What&#39;s more, the type of missing data is Missing at Random(MAR). We can prove it using the data of Kermadec Island Station and New Zealand Station. We can find before 1975, both stations don&#39;t have any data. This trend exists in almost every station. For most stations, the former data has a higher percentage of missing data. However, the missing patterns between stations are still different except for the former year. In ker, the missing data around 2020 is more, while the missing data of nzd around 2020 shows little difference with other years. Thus, the missing data of our dataset is Missing At Random. Since each station starts recording data and ends recording data at different times, that&#39;s why we don’t have many complete cases, but we can still observe the trend of co2 generated by each station over time according to its own timeline.
