As the main gas causing the greenhouse effect, CO2 emissions have always been highly concerned. Since the industrial revolution, with the massive consumption of fossil fuels, CO2 emissions have increased year by year. As a global issue, does CO2 distribution have the same trend all over the world? Through monitoring stations around the world, we hope to discover the laws and trends of CO2 emissions and their distribution. Are there significant differences in CO2 concentration in different locations? In addition, The COVID-19 pandemic being the most consequential global event in the year of 2020 has impacted everyone and every country in the world. When all kinds of production and lifestyle are greatly affected, will CO2 emissions be affected accordingly? Therefore, we decide to conduct an analytical study on CO2 data collected by several observatory stations. We aim to use exploratory data analysis to study if there is any trends on CO2 emissions changes, whether there exists any regional effects on CO2 distribution and the effect of COVID-19 on CO2-emissions. In the project, we collected the observatory data from The Scripps CO2 program to generate visualizations and conduct investigations on the CO2 emissions changing trend. We would like to carry out analysis from both geographic and time series perspectives and answer the following questions:: Through the CO2 data collected from a range of years, we can use time series to analysis its changing trend. Noting there are a number of observatory stations, there may exists some differences between their trends. Since the data is collected from several stations in different locations, their CO2 data may seem not the same. We want to exam the difference between them and analysis the factor causing the difference, for instance, their latitude and longitude. During the COVID-19 period, what is the change of CO2 emissions trend? Does COVID-19 have a big impact on CO2 emissions? In the following chapters, we will discuss these questions and provide some new insights on forecasting the future CO2 emissions.

Below is the information for each sampling station. We will be using the Station Code column representing each station throughout the project.

Some stations start in early 1960s, while other stations have large number of missing values from 1960s through 1980s. This may create inconsistency if we generate analysis on the whole time period. 2.3 Seawater Carbon Data Dataset : BATS.csv BERM.csv HAWI.csv We will be using the following columns to analyze the Seawater Carbon Data.

Take alt as an example, it contains 10 columns. Columns 1-4 provide different formats of dates, so we keep only the year and month columns. Columns 5-10 are monthly CO2 concentrations in different versions that have been adjusted. We only use column 5 in this project because it is the most standard. ## Yr Mn Date.Excel Date CO2..ppm. seasonally..adjusted fit..ppm. ## 13 2012 1 40923 2012.041 399.10 394.87 398.02 ## 14 2012 2 40954 2012.126 398.83 393.60 399.20 ## 15 2012 3 40983 2012.205 399.40 393.67 399.85 ## 16 2012 4 41014 2012.290 400.07 394.39 400.00 ## 17 2012 5 41044 2012.372 400.42 394.75 400.17 ## 18 2012 6 41075 2012.456 397.28 394.51 397.47 ## 19 2012 7 41105 2012.538 389.59 394.40 390.11 ## 20 2012 8 41136 2012.623 382.70 393.96 383.90 ## 21 2012 9 41167 2012.708 386.00 396.33 385.08 ## 22 2012 10 41197 2012.790 390.42 395.60 390.49 ## seasonally.adjusted.fit..ppm.

This is what the dataset looks like after our selection. ## Yr Mn alt ## 13 2012 1 399.10 ## 14 2012 2 398.83 ## 15 2012 3 399.40 ## 16 2012 4 400.07 ## 17 2012 5 400.42 ## 18 2012 6 397.28 ## 19 2012 7 389.59 ## 20 2012 8 382.70 ## 21 2012 9 386.00 ## 22 2012 10 390.42 Then we do the same thing for all the stations of different locations.

Firstly, we change the numerical value of months to categories, such as January and February. Secondly, we separate our stations into two categories, in the northern hemisphere and in the southern hemisphere.

In addition, we want to get the yearly CO2 concentrations for all the stations. So we aggregate station columns and get the average of all the months. After we tidy the data, we finally get our transformed data “yearly_co2”. ## # A tibble: 10 x 3 ## Yr station CO2_concentration ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2012 alt 395. ## 2 2012 mlo 394. ## 3 2012 kum 395. ## 4 2012 chr 394. ## 5 2012 sam 392. ## 6 2012 ker 391. ## 7 2012 nzd 390. ## 8 2013 alt 397. ## 9 2013 mlo 397. ## 10 2013 kum 397. "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values We use a single file “monthly_flask_co2” as an example to analyze the missing data in our project. This file contains monthly co2 data collected from several different inspection stations, whose locations are shown in the figure below. Inspection stations Read data from “monthly_flask_co2”. ## Yr Mn alt mlo kum chr sam ker nzd ## 1 1960 1 NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN ## 2 1960 2 NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN ## 3 1960 3 NaN 317.69 NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN ## 4 1960 4 NaN 319.06 NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN ## 5 1960 5 NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN ## 6 1960 6 NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN ## 7 1960 7 NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN ## 8 1960 8 NaN 315.74 NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN ## 9 1960 9 NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN ## 10 1960 10 NaN 312.84 NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN Variable description: Yr: year Mn: month alt: Alert Station mlo: Mauna Loa Observatory kum: Cape Kumukahi Station chr: Christmas Island Station sam: American Samoa Station ker: Kermadec Island Station nzd: New Zealand Station Firstly, we analysis its missing patterns. As shown in the above graph, each inspection station has NA values in its column, while year and month columns don’t have missing data. The Alert station has the highest missing percentage and missing count while the Mauna Loa Observatory has the lowest missing percentage and missing count. What’s more, the type of missing data is Missing at Random(MAR). We can prove it by using the data of Kermadec Island Station and New Zealand Station. We can observe that before 1975, both stations don’t have any data. This trend exists in almost every station. For most stations, the former data has a higher percentage of missing data. However, the missing patterns between stations are still different except for the former year. In Kermadec Island Station, the missing data around 2020 is more, while the missing data of New Zealand Station around 2020 shows little difference with other years. Thus, the missing data of our dataset is Missing At Random. Since each station starts and ends recording data at different times, that’s why we don’t have many complete cases, but we can still observe the trend of co2 generated by each station over time according to its own timeline. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 CO2 changes by time 5.2 Factors affecting the CO2 changes 5.3 CO2 changes during Covid-19 pandemic", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 CO2 changes by time From this graph, we can conclude that there are increasingly amount of C02 concentrations for all the stations on the whole year by year over time. And this trend is consistent for all sampling stations. 5.2 Factors affecting the CO2 changes 5.2.1 locations: different sampling stations From this graph, we can conclude that the median monthly CO2 concentration values are similar accross all the stations except for the Alert Station. The Alert Station has a median of more than 400, while the median of others are approximately between 350 and 375. That’s because the Alert Station started to record data only from 2011, so it has a small range. The highest monthly CO2 concentration also comes form the Alert Station, which is almost 425. Besides the Alert Station, Cape Kumukahi Station and American Samoa Station have higher monthly CO2 concentration than Kermadec Island Station than the other three stations. The data for Mauna Loa Observatory is the most sparse because it is the earliest station to record data, and that’s why its median is the lowest. There are no outliers. 5.2.2 Sea water features The sea water is continuously changing as well. In the data, one feature of sea water is the salinity. From the above graphs, we can see that there is somehow some relation between Salinity and carbon in sea water. Sea water with higher salinity tend to have larger amount of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). This is a potential factor to the CO2 concentration differences. 5.3 CO2 changes during Covid-19 pandemic The shaded area is the time period during the Covid-19 pandemic. We select the time interval starting from 2020 March to present. And we want to focus on this interval to see if the pandemic affects the CO2 emission.
