As the main gas causing the greenhouse effect, CO2 emissions have always been highly concerned. Since the industrial revolution, with the massive consumption of fossil fuels, CO2 emissions have increased year by year. As a global issue, does CO2 distribution have the same trend all over the world? Through monitoring stations around the world, we hope to discover the laws and trends of CO2 emissions and their distribution. Are there significant differences in CO2 concentration in different locations? In addition, The COVID-19 pandemic being the most consequential global event in the year of 2020 has impacted everyone and every country in the world. When all kinds of production and lifestyle are greatly affected, will CO2 emissions be affected accordingly? Therefore, we decide to conduct an analytical study on CO2 data collected by several observatory stations. We aim to use exploratory data analysis to study if there is any trends on CO2 emissions changes, whether there exists any regional effects on CO2 distribution and the effect of COVID-19 on CO2-emissions. In the project, we collected the observatory data from The Scripps CO2 program to generate visualizations and conduct investigations on the CO2 emissions changing trend. We would like to carry out analysis from both geographic and time series perspectives and answer the following questions:: Through the CO2 data collected from a range of years, we can use time series to analysis its changing trend. Noting there are a number of observatory stations, there may exists some differences between their trends. Since the data is collected from several stations in different locations, their CO2 data may seem not the same. We want to exam the difference between them and analysis the factor causing the difference, for instance, their latitude and longitude. During the COVID-19 period, what is the change of CO2 emissions trend? Does COVID-19 have a big impact on CO2 emissions? In the following chapters, we will discuss these questions and provide some new insights on forecasting the future CO2 emissions.

Below is the information for each sampling station. We will be using the Station Code column representing each station throughout the project.

Some stations start in early 1960s, while other stations have large number of missing values from 1960s through 1980s. This may create inconsistency if we generate analysis on the whole time period. 2.3 Seawater Carbon Data Dataset : BATS.csv BERM.csv HAWI.csv We will be using the following columns to analyze the Seawater Carbon Data.

Take alt as an example, it contains 10 columns. Columns 1-4 provide different formats of dates, so we keep only the year and month columns. Columns 5-10 are monthly CO2 concentrations in different versions that have been adjusted. We only use column 5 in this project because it is the most standard. ## Yr Mn Date.Excel Date CO2..ppm. seasonally..adjusted fit..ppm. ## 1 2011 1 40558 2011.041 NaN NaN 395.66 ## 2 2011 2 40589 2011.126 NaN NaN 396.87 ## 3 2011 3 40617 2011.203 NaN NaN 397.54 ## 4 2011 4 40648 2011.288 NaN NaN 397.70 ## 5 2011 5 40678 2011.370 NaN NaN 397.90 ## 6 2011 6 40709 2011.455 NaN NaN 395.29 ## 7 2011 7 40739 2011.537 NaN NaN 387.95 ## 8 2011 8 40770 2011.622 NaN NaN 381.62 ## 9 2011 9 40801 2011.707 381.93 392.29 382.68 ## 10 2011 10 40831 2011.789 388.07 393.28 388.02 ## seasonally.adjusted.fit..ppm.

This is what the dataset looks like after our selection. ## Yr Mn alt ## 1 2011 1 NaN ## 2 2011 2 NaN ## 3 2011 3 NaN ## 4 2011 4 NaN ## 5 2011 5 NaN ## 6 2011 6 NaN ## 7 2011 7 NaN ## 8 2011 8 NaN ## 9 2011 9 381.93 ## 10 2011 10 388.07 Then we do the same thing for all the stations of different locations.

"],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values We use a single file “monthly_flask_co2” as an example to analyze the missing data in our project. This file contains monthly co2 data collected from several different inspection stations, whose locations are shown in the figure below. Inspection stations Read data from “monthly_flask_co2”. ## Yr Mn alt mlo kum chr sam ker nzd ## 1 1960 1 NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN ## 2 1960 2 NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN ## 3 1960 3 NaN 317.69 NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN ## 4 1960 4 NaN 319.06 NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN ## 5 1960 5 NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN ## 6 1960 6 NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN ## 7 1960 7 NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN ## 8 1960 8 NaN 315.74 NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN ## 9 1960 9 NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN ## 10 1960 10 NaN 312.84 NaN NaN NaN NaN NaN Variable description: Yr: year Mn: month alt: Alert Station mlo: Mauna Loa Observatory kum: Cape Kumukahi Station chr: Christmas Island Station sam: American Samoa Station ker: Kermadec Island Station nzd: New Zealand Station Firstly, we analysis its missing patterns. As shown in the above graph, each inspection station has NA values in its column, while year and month columns don’t have missing data. The Alert station has the highest missing percentage and missing count while the Mauna Loa Observatory has the lowest missing percentage and missing count. What’s more, the type of missing data is Missing at Random(MAR). We can prove it by using the data of Kermadec Island Station and New Zealand Station. We can observe that before 1975, both stations don’t have any data. This trend exists in almost every station. For most stations, the former data has a higher percentage of missing data. However, the missing patterns between stations are still different except for the former year. In Kermadec Island Station, the missing data around 2020 is more, while the missing data of New Zealand Station around 2020 shows little difference with other years. Thus, the missing data of our dataset is Missing At Random. Since each station starts and ends recording data at different times, that’s why we don’t have many complete cases, but we can still observe the trend of co2 generated by each station over time according to its own timeline. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 CO2 changes by time 5.2 Factors affecting the CO2 changes 5.3 CO2 changes during Covid-19 pandemic", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 CO2 changes by time From this graph, we can conclude that there are increasingly amount of C02 concentrations for all the stations on the whole year by year over time. And this trend is consistent for all sampling stations. 5.2 Factors affecting the CO2 changes 5.2.1 locations: different sampling stations From this graph, we can conclude that the median monthly CO2 concentration values are similar accross all the stations except for the Alert Station. The Alert Station has a median of more than 400, while the median of others are approximately between 350 and 375. That’s because the Alert Station started to record data only from 2011, so it has a small range. The highest monthly CO2 concentration also comes form the Alert Station, which is almost 425. Besides the Alert Station, Cape Kumukahi Station and American Samoa Station have higher monthly CO2 concentration than Kermadec Island Station than the other three stations. The data for Mauna Loa Observatory is the most sparse because it is the earliest station to record data, and that’s why its median is the lowest. There are no outliers. 5.2.2 Sea water features The sea water is continuously changing as well. In the data, one feature of sea water is the salinity. From the above graphs, we can see that there is somehow some relation between Salinity and carbon in sea water. Sea water with higher salinity tend to have larger amount of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). This is a potential factor to the CO2 concentration differences. 5.3 CO2 changes during Covid-19 pandemic "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
