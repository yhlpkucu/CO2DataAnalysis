As the main gas causing the greenhouse effect, CO2 emissions have always been highly concerned. Since the industrial revolution, with the massive consumption of fossil fuels, CO2 emissions have increased year by year. As a global issue, does CO2 distribution have the same trend all over the world? Through monitoring stations around the world, we hope to discover the laws and trends of CO2 emissions and their distribution. Are there significant differences in CO2 concentration in different locations? In addition, The COVID-19 pandemic being the most consequential global event in the year 2020 has impacted everyone and every country in the world. When all kinds of production and lifestyle are greatly affected, will CO2 emissions be affected accordingly? Therefore, we decide to conduct an analytical study on CO2 data collected by several observatory stations. We aim to use exploratory data analysis to study if there are any trends in CO2 emissions changes, whether there exist any regional effects on CO2 distribution and the effect of COVID-19 on CO2 emissions. In the project, we have collected the observatory data from The Scripps CO2 program to generate visualizations and conduct investigations on the CO2 emissions changing trends. We would like to carry out analysis from both geographic and time series perspectives and answer the following questions: Through the CO2 data collected from a range of years, we can use time series to analyze its changing trend. Noting there are a number of observatory stations, there may exist some differences between their trends. Since the data is collected from several stations in different locations, their CO2 data may seem not the same. We want to exam the difference between them and analyze the factor causing the difference, for instance, their latitude and longitude. During the COVID-19 period, what is the change of CO2 emissions trend? Does COVID-19 have a big impact on CO2 emissions? In the following chapters, we will discuss these questions and provide some new insights on forecasting future CO2 emissions. Click here for more details about this project.

As shown in the above graph, each inspection station has NA values in its column, while year and month columns don’t have missing data. The Alert station has the highest missing percentage and missing count while the Mauna Loa Observatory has the lowest missing percentage and missing count. What’s more, the type of missing data is Missing at Random(MAR). We can prove it by using the data of Kermadec Island Station and New Zealand Station. We can observe that before 1974, both stations don’t have any data. This trend exists in almost every station. For most stations, the former data has a higher percentage of missing data. However, the missing patterns between stations are still different except for the former year. In Christmas Island Station, the missing data around 2020 is more, while the missing data of the Alert Station becomes 0 since it has data after 2011. Thus, the missing data of our dataset is Missing At Random. Since each station starts and ends recording data at different times, that’s why we don’t have many complete cases, but we can still observe the trend of CO2 generated by each station over time according to its own timeline. "],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 CO2 changes by time 5.2 Factors affecting the CO2 changes 5.3 CO2 changes during Covid-19 pandemic", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 CO2 changes by time 5.1.1 General trend The CO2 concentration in this graph is the average CO2 concentration of all the months of the whole year. From this graph, we can conclude that on the whole there are increasing amount of C02 concentrations for all the stations year by year over time. And this trend is consistent for all sampling stations. 5.1.2 Adjusted data We select the year 2017 to 2019 as an example. The original data has two columns: “CO2.filled..ppm” and “seasonally.adjusted.filled..ppm” representing the original CO2 concentration collected and the CO2 concentration after removing the quasi-regular seasonal cycle adjusted, respectively. As shown in the red points, we can see that there is a clear pattern of the CO2 concentration following the pattern of months (seasons). However, in the blue points, we can see that the trend is consistent, and there is no such pattern for points to drift up and down, which is appropriate since the adjusted method is to remove the seasonal cycle. Therefore though these two columns all indicate the CO2 concentration information, they might have different results using different methods. 5.2 Factors affecting the CO2 changes 5.2.1 Time: months We use stations Mauna Loa Observatory and Cape Kumukahi Station, which are both in the northern hemisphere, from 2001 to 2020 to generate this graph. The CO2 concentration in this graph is the sum of the CO2 concentration of these two stations for each month. We can inspect that the CO2 concentration in each month shows great differences. In summer, the CO2 concentration gets to a high level, while it is relatively low in spring and autumn. We can conclude that there are some factors related to time causing such a situation. Primarily, temperature and human activities are all vital influencing factors. 5.2.2 Location: sampling stations The monthly CO2 concentration in this graph is basically the CO2 concentration of all the months. From this graph, we can conclude that the median monthly CO2 concentration values are similar across all the stations except for the Alert Station. The Alert Station has a median of more than 400, while the median of others is approximately between 350 and 375. That’s because the Alert Station started to record data only from 2011, so it has a small range. The highest monthly CO2 concentration also comes from the Alert Station, which is almost 425. Besides the Alert Station, Cape Kumukahi Station and American Samoa Station have higher monthly CO2 concentrations than Kermadec Island Station than the other three stations. The data for Mauna Loa Observatory is the most sparse because it is the earliest station to record data, and that’s why its median is the lowest. There are no outliers. 5.2.3 Location: air pressure Although we collect our data from three air pressures, no matter what air pressure is, CO2 concentrations are concentrated between 300 to 325. From this graph, we can also see that there are few outliers, which will be flagged as contaminated and moved from the final result. 5.2.4 Location: hemispheres We select the year 2011 to 2019 as an example for both graphs. So the monthly CO2 concentration in this graph is basically the CO2 concentration of all the months from 2011 to 2019. We find that the northern hemisphere and the southern hemisphere have different trends for the monthly CO2 concentration. In the northern hemisphere, the red point represents the CO2 concentration for May, which is the peak of each year. Meanwhile, in the southern hemisphere, the blue point represents the CO2 concentration for January, which is almost the peak for most years. Due to different geographical locations, seasons and weather may differ, which results in different CO2 concentrations. 5.2.5 Sea water features The sea water is continuously changing as well. In the data, one feature of sea water is the salinity. From the above graphs, we can see that there is somehow some relation between Salinity and carbon in sea water. Sea water with higher salinity tends to have a larger amount of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC). This is a potential factor in the CO2 concentration differences. 5.3 CO2 changes during Covid-19 pandemic The shaded area is the time period during the Covid-19 pandemic. We select the time interval starting from 2020 March to the present. And we want to focus on this interval to see if the pandemic affects CO2 emission. 5.3.1 Increment ratio comparison From the above graphs, it seems like the ranges of CO2 concentration increment ratio each month for covid and non-covid time periods are both between 0.98 and 1.02, and they are both bell-shaped. Besides, we can see the differences between the blue and lightblue columns that the count of the increment ratio during covid pandemic is slightly smaller than that in normal time periods. But the differences are subtle as the x-scale we have is all spreading between small units 0.98 to 1.02, so we can say that during the past one and a half years, the increment of CO2 concentration was not largely affected by Covid-19. The trends are approximately the same. We can roughly infer that the Covid-19 pandemic does not have a significant impact on CO2 concentration. 5.3.2 Trend during pandemic We select data from 2018 March to 2019 November and compared it with the Covid-19 pandemic (2020 March to 2021 November). We can see that the pattern for these two periods is generally the same. This is reasonable because the pattern is mainly affected by the seasonal cycle which is irrelevant to Covid-19. However, when we try to model the regression line for both data, we can see that the line are almost the same during this time interval (20 months), which is consistent with the observations above that there are no significant effects of Covid-19 on the CO2 concentration. But as displayed in the graph, the slopes vary. And the slope of the regression model during Covid is about half of that during normal times. Hence, in long run, we would assume that though the difference is not so visible during 20 months, it might have a more significant influence on CO2 emissions. And it is possible that CO2 concentration will be somehow decreased more if the condition is going to last for a long time.

"],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion After our exploratory data analysis, we can conclude that the CO2 concentration consistently increases over these years in general. It can be affected by many factors. Given the data sources we have, time, location, and sea water features can affect the CO2 concentration. It follows a pattern that the CO2 concentration is higher in summer but relatively lower in spring and autumn in both northern and southern hemispheres. So the monthly CO2 concentration in the northern and southern hemispheres have completely different patterns. The northern hemisphere has its peak in May, while the southern hemisphere has its peak in January. On the other hand, even though there are 7 sampling stations that Scipps CO2 Program collecting the CO2 data, this does not have significant effects on the CO2 concentration. But having more samples helps us generate more accurate observations. In addition, the higher the salinity of seawater is, the higher the content of soluble inorganic carbon (DIC) is. Although we suspect that COVID-19 had an effect on CO2 concentration, we find that the effect is so subtle that it can be negligible for the past one and a half years. However, since there is still a slight difference, as COVID-19 becomes a regular event, this difference will increase over time, we might expect CO2 concentrations to get lower in the long run. On the other hand, there are limitations in this project. The raw data sources in Scipps CO2 Program have very few categorical variables. So it was challenging for us at first to generate an analysis on different features. There were very limited choices of types of graphs we could plot on. To solve this problem, we manually add a few categories to the data. For example, we add a variable to represent the hemisphere based on the latitude of inspection stations. And we also add a category representing whether the date is in Covid-19 time period. To have more comprehensive perspectives on CO2 emission, more categories and dimensions might be needed. Also, as shown in the map in Chapter1:Introduction, the sampling stations are mainly located in a similar longitude. This might create a limitation to this project as well since we lack the information on CO2 that is collected from other various locations. In the future, we can still gather more data sources regarding to the CO2 concentration. Besides Scipps CO2 Program, more data can be used for future analysis. The emission of CO2 is a wide-ranging topic. It can be related to many other factors such as chemicals, elevations, population, technology, human activities, etc. Even for the topic of Covid-19, we can continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 on CO2 concentrations, as this is just the beginning. And Scipps CO2 Program is a program that is consistently updating the data. More analysis can be made with future observations.
